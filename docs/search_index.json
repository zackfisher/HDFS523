This is common across all variable types and can occur for character strings, numeric, integer and factor types. For example, we would expect the grad variable to only take the values of zero or one. We can use the table() function to quickly confirm this. By default table() simply omits any values coded as NA. To include a count of the NA values use the useNA argument of table() as follows: table(wisc3raw$grad, useNA = &quot;always&quot;) ## ## 0 1 &lt;NA&gt; ## 158 46 0 "],["2.6-missing-data.html", "2.6 Missing Data", " 2.6 Missing Data Dealing with missing data in a consistent manner is one of the most important aspects of data cleaning. When data are imported into R it is common to discover missing values are coded according to a variety of conventions. Often a first step in handling missing data involves recoding missing values as NA. Writing bespoke code to handle the different types of missing data one might encounter is tedious and unnecessary. naniar (Tierney et al. 2021) is a useful package with many convenience functions for managing missing data in R. Here we demonstrate some of this functionality. 2.6.1 Generating Example Data Since the WISC data does not contain missing values it is helpful to generate a synthetic dataset containing some commonly encountered missing data codes. set.seed(123) wisc_miss &lt;- wisc3raw wisc_miss$verb1[sample(nrow(wisc_miss),100)] &lt;- -99 wisc_miss$comp1[sample(nrow(wisc_miss),75)] &lt;- &quot;N/A&quot; wisc_miss$info1[sample(nrow(wisc_miss),50)] &lt;- &quot;NA&quot; 2.6.2 Recoding Values with NA Now that we have a dataset with missing values we can use naniar to recode these values to NA. na_strings &lt;- c(&quot;NA&quot;, &quot;N/A&quot;, -99) wisc_miss &lt;- naniar::replace_with_na_all( wisc_miss, condition = ~.x %in% na_strings ) See the naniar vignette on recoding NA values for more detailed information on the package functionality. 2.6.3 Missing Data Visualization Once we have recoded our data in a consistent manner we can use visualizations to explore the missing data. The vis_miss() function from naniar is a good starting point for visualizing the amount of missing data in our dataset. The plots shows the missing values in black and non-missing values in gray. In addition, percentages of missing data in both the dataset and individual variables are provided. naniar::vis_miss(wisc_miss) Many missing data visualizations are described in the naniar vignette on missing data visualization including plots for exploring missing data mechanisms.

"],["2.8-reshaping-repeated-measures-data.html", "2.8 Reshaping Repeated Measures Data", " 2.8 Reshaping Repeated Measures Data Behavioral science tends to use relational data structures - in basic form, spreadsheets. Typically, the data are stored in a data frame (a “fancy” matrix) with multiple rows and columns. Two common schemata used to accommodate repeated measures data are wide format and long format. Different analysis and plotting functions require different kinds of data input. Thus, it is imperative that one can convert the data back and forth between wide and long formats. There are lots of ways to do this. We illustrate one way. Sidebar: The dput() function provides a convenient method to get the variable names (or any R object) into a format that can be read back into R. For example, this can be helpful when working with a long vector of strings. dput(colnames(wisc3raw)) ## c(&quot;id&quot;, &quot;verb1&quot;, &quot;verb2&quot;, &quot;verb4&quot;, &quot;verb6&quot;, &quot;perfo1&quot;, &quot;perfo2&quot;, ## &quot;perfo4&quot;, &quot;perfo6&quot;, &quot;info1&quot;, &quot;comp1&quot;, &quot;simu1&quot;, &quot;voca1&quot;, &quot;info6&quot;, ## &quot;comp6&quot;, &quot;simu6&quot;, &quot;voca6&quot;, &quot;momed&quot;, &quot;grad&quot;, &quot;constant&quot;) First, let’s subset our data to only include the variables we need for this analysis. var_names_sub &lt;- c( &quot;id&quot;, &quot;verb1&quot;, &quot;verb2&quot;, &quot;verb4&quot;, &quot;verb6&quot;, &quot;perfo1&quot;, &quot;perfo2&quot;, &quot;perfo4&quot;, &quot;perfo6&quot;, &quot;momed&quot;, &quot;grad&quot; ) wiscraw &lt;- wisc3raw[,var_names_sub] head(wiscraw) ## id verb1 verb2 verb4 verb6 perfo1 perfo2 perfo4 perfo6 momed grad ## 1 1 24.42 26.98 39.61 55.64 19.84 22.97 43.90 44.19 9.5 0 ## 2 2 12.44 14.38 21.92 37.81 5.90 13.44 18.29 40.38 5.5 0 ## 3 3 32.43 33.51 34.30 50.18 27.64 45.02 46.99 77.72 14.0 1 ## 4 4 22.69 28.39 42.16 44.72 33.16 29.68 45.97 61.66 14.0 1 ## 5 5 28.23 37.81 41.06 70.95 27.64 44.42 65.48 64.22 11.5 0 ## 6 6 16.06 20.12 38.02 39.94 8.45 15.78 26.99 39.08 14.0 1 2.8.1 Reshape Wide to Long One way to go from wide to long is using the reshape() function from base R. Notice, the varying argument contains the repeated measures columns we want to stack and the timevar is a new variable containing the grade level information previosuly appended at the end of the colnames listed in varying. # reshape data from wide to long wisclong &lt;- reshape( data = wiscraw, varying = c(&quot;verb1&quot;, &quot;verb2&quot;, &quot;verb4&quot;,&quot;verb6&quot;, &quot;perfo1&quot;,&quot;perfo2&quot;,&quot;perfo4&quot;,&quot;perfo6&quot;), timevar = c(&quot;grade&quot;), idvar = c(&quot;id&quot;), direction = &quot;long&quot;, sep = &quot;&quot; ) # reorder by id and day wisclong &lt;- wisclong[ order(wisclong$id, wisclong$grade), ] head(wisclong, 8) ## id momed grad grade verb perfo ## 1.1 1 9.5 0 1 24.42 19.84 ## 1.2 1 9.5 0 2 26.98 22.97 ## 1.4 1 9.5 0 4 39.61 43.90 ## 1.6 1 9.5 0 6 55.64 44.19 ## 2.1 2 5.5 0 1 12.44 5.90 ## 2.2 2 5.5 0 2 14.38 13.44 ## 2.4 2 5.5 0 4 21.92 18.29 ## 2.6 2 5.5 0 6 37.81 40.38 Again, notice how reshape automatically split verb1, verb2, etc. into a string name and a grade variable. 2.8.2 Reshape Long to Wide Now we go from long to wide, again using the reshape() function. The v.names argument specifies the variables to be expanded column wise based on the repeated measure specified in timevar. #reshaping long to wide wiscwide &lt;- reshape( data = wisclong, timevar = c(&quot;grade&quot;), idvar = c(&quot;id&quot;), v.names = c(&quot;verb&quot;,&quot;perfo&quot;), direction = &quot;wide&quot;, sep = &quot;&quot; ) # reordering columns wiscwide &lt;- wiscwide[, c( &quot;id&quot;, &quot;verb1&quot;, &quot;verb2&quot;, &quot;verb4&quot;, &quot;verb6&quot;, &quot;perfo1&quot;, &quot;perfo2&quot;, &quot;perfo4&quot;, &quot;perfo6&quot;, &quot;momed&quot;,&quot;grad&quot; )] head(wiscwide) ## id verb1 verb2 verb4 verb6 perfo1 perfo2 perfo4 perfo6 momed grad ## 1.1 1 24.42 26.98 39.61 55.64 19.84 22.97 43.90 44.19 9.5 0 ## 2.1 2 12.44 14.38 21.92 37.81 5.90 13.44 18.29 40.38 5.5 0 ## 3.1 3 32.43 33.51 34.30 50.18 27.64 45.02 46.99 77.72 14.0 1 ## 4.1 4 22.69 28.39 42.16 44.72 33.16 29.68 45.97 61.66 14.0 1 ## 5.1 5 28.23 37.81 41.06 70.95 27.64 44.42 65.48 64.22 11.5 0 ## 6.1 6 16.06 20.12 38.02 39.94 8.45 15.78 26.99 39.08 14.0 1 Using functions included in base R can be useful in a number of situations. One example is package development where one may wants to limit dependencies. That said, many people find reshape to be unnecessarily complicated. A similar, and potentially more convenient, set of functions have been developed for reshaping data in the tidyr (Wickham 2021) package. For those interested take a look at the pivot_longer() and pivot_wider() functions. For examples using tidyr to reshape data see the tidyr vignette on pivoting.

We should really consider the time-dependence when we are looking at descriptive statistics and plots. Let’s now look at verbal ability scores across time collapsed across individuals. This can be done using either the describe() function and the wide data or the describeBy() function and the long data. Let’s look at descriptives using the wide data. psych::describe(wiscwide[,c(&quot;verb1&quot;,&quot;verb2&quot;,&quot;verb4&quot;,&quot;verb6&quot;)]) ## vars n mean sd median trimmed mad min max range skew ## verb1 1 204 19.59 5.81 19.34 19.50 5.41 3.33 35.15 31.82 0.13 ## verb2 2 204 25.42 6.11 25.98 25.40 6.57 5.95 39.85 33.90 -0.06 ## verb4 3 204 32.61 7.32 32.82 32.42 7.18 12.60 52.84 40.24 0.23 ## verb6 4 204 43.75 10.67 42.55 43.46 11.30 17.35 72.59 55.24 0.24 ## kurtosis se ## verb1 -0.05 0.41 ## verb2 -0.34 0.43 ## verb4 -0.08 0.51 ## verb6 -0.36 0.75 Identical results can be obtained using the long data. psych::describeBy(wisclong[,c(&quot;verb&quot;)], group = wisclong$grade) ## ## Descriptive statistics by group ## group: 1 ## vars n mean sd median trimmed mad min max range skew kurtosis se ## X1 1 204 19.59 5.81 19.34 19.5 5.41 3.33 35.15 31.82 0.13 -0.05 0.41 ## ------------------------------------------------------------ ## group: 2 ## vars n mean sd median trimmed mad min max range skew kurtosis se ## X1 1 204 25.42 6.11 25.98 25.4 6.57 5.95 39.85 33.9 -0.06 -0.34 0.43 ## ------------------------------------------------------------ ## group: 4 ## vars n mean sd median trimmed mad min max range skew kurtosis se ## X1 1 204 32.61 7.32 32.82 32.42 7.18 12.6 52.84 40.24 0.23 -0.08 0.51 ## ------------------------------------------------------------ ## group: 6 ## vars n mean sd median trimmed mad min max range skew kurtosis ## X1 1 204 43.75 10.67 42.55 43.46 11.3 17.35 72.59 55.24 0.24 -0.36 ## se ## X1 0.75 We can visualize the distribution of verbal scores across grades in a number of different ways.

From Wikipedia: Notched box plots apply a notch or narrowing of the box around the median. Notches are useful in offering a rough guide of the significance of the difference of medians; if the notches of two boxes do not overlap, this can provide evidence of a statistically significant difference between the medians. Adding the mean value to the plot gives us additonal information about central tendency and skew of the distribution. #boxplot by grade ggplot(data=wisclong, aes(x=factor(grade), y=verb)) + geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE) + stat_summary(fun=&quot;mean&quot;, geom=&quot;point&quot;, shape=23, size=3, fill=&quot;white&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Verbal Ability Score (across grades 1, 2, 4, 6)&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Verbal Ability Score&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Grade&quot;) + theme_bw() + theme( panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), strip.background = element_blank() ) Finally, we can view overlapping densities of the within-grade distributions of verbal ability scores. ggplot(data=wisclong, aes(x=verb)) + geom_density(aes(group=factor(grade), colour=factor(grade), fill=factor(grade)), alpha=0.3) + guides(colour=&quot;none&quot;, fill=guide_legend(title=&quot;Grade&quot;)) + ggtitle(&quot;Verbal Ability Score (across grades 1, 2, 4, 6)&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Density&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Verbal Ability Score&quot;) + theme_bw() + theme( panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), strip.background = element_blank() ) Notice in these plots how much “change” there is at the sample level across grades.

First, using the pairs() function from base R. pairs(wiscwide[,c(&quot;verb1&quot;,&quot;verb2&quot;,&quot;verb4&quot;,&quot;verb6&quot;)]) There is also a pairs.panel() function in the psych package.

We need to consider how each individual is changing over time. Thus, we are interested in verbal ability across Time for each individual person. Visualization is typically our best tool for synthesizing the large amounts of information in individual-level data. ggplot(data = wisclong, aes(x = grade, y = verb, group = id)) + geom_point() + geom_line() + scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,6,by=1)) + ylim(0,80) + ggtitle(&quot;Verbal Ability Score (across grades 1, 2, 4, 6)&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Grade&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Verbal Ability Score&quot;) + theme_bw() + theme( panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), strip.background = element_blank() ) Sometimes the “blob” gets too dense.

The number of columns in the premultiplier must equal the number of rows in the post multiplier.

Graphical Depiction of Rule 3 https://code.kx.com/q/ref/mmu/ Matrix multiplication is associative (i.e. rearranging the parentheses in an expression will not change the result). That is, \\[ \\mathbf{(AB)C} = \\mathbf{A(BC)} \\] and is distributive with respect to addition, \\[ \\mathbf{A(B+C)} = \\mathbf{AB + AC} \\\\ \\mathbf{(B+C)A} = \\mathbf{BA + CA} \\\\ \\] If \\(c\\) is a scalar, then \\[ c(\\mathbf{AB})=c(\\mathbf{A})\\mathbf{B}=\\mathbf{A}(c\\mathbf{B})=(\\mathbf{AB})c \\] or equivalently, \\[ \\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} 10 &amp; 5 \\\\ 9 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\enspace k=2, \\enspace k\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} 20 &amp; 10 \\\\ 18 &amp; 2 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] In general, matrices that can be multiplied are called ‘compatible’ or ‘comformable.’ Matrices in which the inner dimensions (i.e., columns of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), rows of \\(\\mathbf{B}\\)) do not match are called ‘incompatible’ or ‘non-conformable.’ These cannot be multiplied. 4.2.6 Matrix Division Division is not defined for matrix operations, but may be accomplished by multiplication by the inverse matrix. In algebra, the reciprocal of a scalar is, by definition, the scalar raised to the minus one power (e.g. \\(5^{-1} = 1/5\\)), and equations may be solved by multiplication by reciprocals. For example: \\[ 5^{-1} = 1/5\\\\ 5x=35\\\\ 5^{-1}(5x)=5^{-1}(35)\\\\ x = 7 \\] Now consider the following equation where the vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is unknown, \\[ \\mathbf{A}_{p \\times p} \\mathbf{x}_{p \\times 1} = \\mathbf{b}_{p \\times 1} \\] Each element in the column vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is unknown and the solution involves solving a set of simultaneous equations for the unknown element of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), \\[ a_{11}x_{1} + a_{12}x_{2} + \\dots + a_{1p}x_{p} = b1 \\\\ a_{21}x_{1} + a_{22}x_{2} + \\dots + a_{2p}x_{p} = b2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a_{p1}x_{1} + a_{p2}x_{2} + \\dots + a_{pp}x_{p} = bp \\] A solution analogous to the scalar equations above would give the following solution for the elements of the vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\): \\[ \\mathbf{A}_{p \\times p} \\mathbf{x}_{p \\times 1} = \\mathbf{b}_{p \\times 1} \\\\ \\mathbf{A}^{-1}_{p \\times p}\\mathbf{A}_{p \\times p} \\mathbf{x}_{p \\times 1} = \\mathbf{A}^{-1}_{p \\times p}\\mathbf{b}_{p \\times 1} \\\\ \\mathbf{I}_{p \\times p}\\mathbf{x}_{p \\times 1} = \\mathbf{A}^{-1}_{p \\times p}\\mathbf{b}_{p \\times 1} \\\\ \\mathbf{x}_{p \\times 1} = \\mathbf{A}^{-1}_{p \\times p}\\mathbf{b}_{p \\times 1} \\] The inverse of a matrix must satisfy the following properties: \\[ \\mathbf{AA^{-1}} = \\mathbf{A^{-1}A} = \\mathbf{I} \\] where \\(I\\) is the identity matrix with 1’s along the diagonal and 0’s elsewhere.

The expected value is an “average” of whatever is inside the parentheses. This assumption states that, on average, the error for the \\(ith\\) observation is zero. Here “for all \\(i\\)” means the same is true for all cases. 5.3.2 Assumption 2. Homoscedasticity In statistics, a vector of random variables is heteroscedastic if the variability of the random disturbance is different across elements of the vector, here our \\(\\mathbf{X}\\)s. The errors or disturbances in our model are homoskedastic if the variance of \\(\\epsilon _{i}\\) is a constant (e.g. \\(\\sigma ^{2}\\)), otherwise, they are heteroskedastic. Graphical Depiction of Homoskedasticity and Heteroskedasticity https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoscedasticity 5.3.3 3. \\(\\mathbb{E}(\\epsilon_{i}\\epsilon_{j}) = 0\\) Assumption 3 is sometimes referred to as the autocorrelation assumption. This assumption states that the error terms of different observations should not be correlated with each other. For example, when we have time series data and use lagged variables we may want to examine residuals for the possibility of autocorrelation. Graphical Depiction of Positive and Negative Autocorrelation 5.3.4 4. No Perfect Collinearity Perfect collinearity occurs when one variable is a perfect linear function of any other explanatory variable. If perfect collinearity is found among the \\(\\mathbf{X}\\)s then \\(\\mathbf{(X&#39;X)}\\) has no inverse and OLS estimation fails. Perfect collinearity is unlikely except for programming mistakes such as dummy coding all the values in a nominal variable. 5.3.5 5. \\(\\mathbb{C}(\\epsilon_{i},x_{ki}) = 0\\) Note that \\(\\mathbb{C}()\\) is the covariance operator. Assumption five states that that the error of our equation is uncorrelated with all the \\(\\mathbf{X}\\)s. This is often referred to as an endogeneity assumption. This can be a confusing assumption because by definition the residuals \\(\\hat{e_i}\\) are uncorrelated with the \\(\\mathbf{X}\\)s.

This is often stated as \\(plim(\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\beta}})=\\boldsymbol{{\\beta}}\\). Stated differently, as the sample size grows, the OLS coefficients converge to the true coefficients. 5.4.2 2. Asymptotic Normality Asymptotic normality is another property of the OLS estimator when all assumptions are met. “Asymptotic” refers to how an estimator behaves as the sample size tends to infinity. “Normality” refers to the normal distribution, so an estimator that is asymptotically normal will have an approximately normal distribution as the sample size gets larger. 5.4.3 Variance of \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) Having a variance of \\(\\mathbb{V}(\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\beta}}) = \\sigma^2(\\mathbf{X}&#39;\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\) is another property of the OLS estimator when the previously stated assumptions are met. This means, for example, we can estimate the standard errors from the main diagonal of \\(\\sigma^2(\\mathbf{X}&#39;\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\) and perform significance testing based on this variance. "],["5.5-failure-to-meet-assumptions.html", "5.5 Failure to Meet Assumptions", " 5.5 Failure to Meet Assumptions It is worth thinking about the consequences of not meeting these assumptions. 5.5.1 Failure of Assumption 1. Assumption 1 states \\(\\mathbb{E}(\\epsilon_{i}) = 0\\). This assumption states that, on average, the error for the \\(ith\\) observation is zero. If instead, \\(\\mathbb{E}(\\epsilon_{i}) = c\\) and \\(c \\neq 0\\), and all other assumptions hold, then only the intercept term is biased. Other coefficients OK. 5.5.2 Failure of Assumption 2 or 3. Assumptions 2 and 3 are the homoskedasticity and no autocorrelation assumption, respectively. If we violate (2) or (3), but all other assumptions hold, (1) variance of \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) is no longer dependable, (2) SEs possibly inaccurate, and (3) significance tests are possibly inaccurate. However, importantly, \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) is still an unbiased and consistent estimator. 5.5.3 Failure of Assumption 5. Assumption (5) states that that the error of our equation is uncorrelated with all the \\(\\mathbf{X}\\)s. If this assumption fails, while others hold, OLS is no longer a consistent estimator. "],["5.6-regression-and-matrix-notation.html", "5.6 Regression and Matrix Notation", " 5.6 Regression and Matrix Notation Now that we have reviewed the assumptions of OLS, let’s return to the linear regression model and translate it into a matrix form. 5.6.1 An Intercept-Only Model First, let’s take a simpler form of the model, an intercept-only model where \\[ y_i = \\beta_0 1_{i} + \\epsilon_i.\\] Note that we have made the “silent” 1 explicit. This will become important later (e.g., when fitting growth models). It is worthwhile to look at regression model without predictors to understand what it can tell us about the nature of the intercept (or constant). So here we have no predictors, what is \\(\\beta_0\\)? Here, \\(\\beta_0\\) is the mean of the response variable, and we can show this with some algebra, \\[\\mathbb{E}(y_i)=\\mathbb{E}(\\beta_0 1_{i} + \\epsilon_i)=\\beta_0 1_{i} +\\mathbb{E}( \\epsilon_i)=\\beta_0\\] where \\(\\mathbb{E}( \\epsilon_i)=0\\) (Assumption 1). 5.6.2 Intercept-Only Model in Matrix Form Translating into matrix form, \\(y_i\\) can be written as an \\(N\\) x 1 matrix (a column vector). More specifically, for \\(i = 1\\) to \\(N\\) individuals, \\[ y_i = \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_N \\end{array} \\right] = \\boldsymbol{Y}\\]. (Remember, matrices are often designated as bold capital letters) Doing the same for all the other parts of the model, we get \\[ \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_N \\end{array} \\right] = \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 1 \\end{array} \\right] [\\beta_0] + \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} \\epsilon_1 \\\\ \\epsilon_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\epsilon_N \\end{array} \\right]\\] Note that we have taken care that each matrix is of an order that will allow for matrix multiplication. 5.6.3 Simple Regression in Matrix Form Now, let’s expand our regression model by adding a predictor \\(x_{1i}\\). Our model becomes \\[ y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_{1i} + \\epsilon_i \\] Written out explicitly in matrix form, the model is \\[ \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_N \\end{array} \\right] = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cc} 1, x_{11}\\\\ 1, x_{12}\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 1, x_{1N}\\end{array} \\right] \\left[ \\begin{array}{c}\\beta_0\\\\ \\beta_1\\end{array}\\right] + \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} \\epsilon_1 \\\\ \\epsilon_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\epsilon_N \\end{array} \\right]\\] 5.6.4 Multiple Regression in Matrix Form Finally, extending the model to the general case with \\(q\\) predictor variables, we have \\[ y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_{1i} + \\beta_2x_{2i} + ... + \\beta_qx_{qi} + \\epsilon_i \\] which is written out in matrix form as \\[ \\underbrace{\\left[ \\begin{array}{c} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_N \\end{array} \\right]}_{N \\times 1} = \\underbrace{\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} 1, x_{11}, \\ldots, x_{q1}\\\\ 1, x_{12}, \\ldots, x_{q2}\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 1, x_{1N}, \\ldots, x_{qN}\\end{array} \\right]}_{N \\times (q + 1)} \\underbrace{\\left[ \\begin{array}{c}\\beta_0\\\\ \\beta_1\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\beta_q\\end{array}\\right]}_{(q+1) \\times 1} + \\underbrace{\\left[ \\begin{array}{c} \\epsilon_1 \\\\ \\epsilon_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\epsilon_N \\end{array} \\right]}_{N \\times 1}\\] Where we have the following elements: \\[ \\boldsymbol{Y} = \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_N \\end{array} \\right] ;\\boldsymbol{X} = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} 1, x_{11}, \\ldots, x_{q1}\\\\ 1, x_{12}, \\ldots, x_{q2}\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 1, x_{1N}, \\ldots, x_{qN}\\end{array} \\right]; \\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\left[ \\begin{array}{c}\\beta_0\\\\ \\beta_1\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\beta_q\\end{array}\\right]; \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} = \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} \\epsilon_1 \\\\ \\epsilon_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\epsilon_N \\end{array} \\right] \\] Observe the order of the matrices/vectors. On the right hand side you are matrix multiplying a \\(N \\times (q+1)\\) matrix with a \\((q+1) \\times 1\\) vector. This yields an \\(N \\times 1\\) vector, to which another \\(N \\times 1\\) vector \\(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\) is added, and this is equal to our outcome vector \\(\\boldsymbol{Y}\\) which is also \\(N \\times 1\\). When we implement this model in R, it will be important to know the portions of the model that are in our data frame, \\(y_i\\) and \\({x_{1}, ..., x_{q}}\\), and to have them structured properly. This will become clear in the examples below. Now that we have the model written out explicitly as matrices, we can easily simplify the notation. In compact matrix notation, the regression model then can be written as \\[ \\boldsymbol{Y} = \\boldsymbol{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} \\] "],["5.7-solving-the-regression-equation.html", "5.7 Solving the Regression Equation", " 5.7 Solving the Regression Equation In practice, we would like to know the contents of (i.e., solve for) \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\). Assuming the model is correct, the expected value of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\) is 0, therefore, \\[ \\boldsymbol{Y} = \\boldsymbol{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\] Then we just need to solve for \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\). We can think back about some of the matrix operations we discussed earlier. 5.7.1 Matrix Multiplication and Transpose Our goal is to isolate \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\). One initial idea might be to multiple each side of the equation by \\(\\mathbf{X}^{-1}\\) in an attempt to remove \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) from the right hand side, and isolate \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\). Why won’t this work? Instead, let’s pre-multiply each side of the equation by \\(\\boldsymbol{X&#39;}\\). This would give us \\[ \\boldsymbol{X&#39;}\\boldsymbol{Y} = \\boldsymbol{X&#39;}\\boldsymbol{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\] This gets us a quantity, \\(\\left(\\boldsymbol{X&#39;}\\boldsymbol{X}\\right)\\), a square matrix containing information about the relations among the \\(\\mathbf{x}\\)s. 5.7.2 Matrix Inverse Now, since \\(\\boldsymbol{X&#39;}\\boldsymbol{X}\\) is a square matrix and presumabely has an inverse (e.g. no perfect collinearity), we can premultiply both sides by \\(\\left(\\boldsymbol{X&#39;}\\boldsymbol{X}\\right)^{-1}\\), to obtain \\[ \\left(\\boldsymbol{X&#39;}\\boldsymbol{X}\\right)^{-1} \\left( \\boldsymbol{X&#39;}\\boldsymbol{Y}\\right) = \\left(\\boldsymbol{X&#39;}\\boldsymbol{X}\\right)^{-1} (\\boldsymbol{X&#39;}\\boldsymbol{X}) \\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\] Remembering our assumptions that a matrix multiplied by its inverse equals the identity matrix, \\((\\boldsymbol{X&#39;}\\boldsymbol{X})^{-1} (\\boldsymbol{X&#39;}\\boldsymbol{X})=\\mathbf{I}\\) the equation simplifies to \\[ \\left(\\boldsymbol{X&#39;}\\boldsymbol{X}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X&#39;}\\boldsymbol{Y}\\right) = \\boldsymbol{I}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\] or more succinctly \\[ \\left(\\boldsymbol{X&#39;}\\boldsymbol{X}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X&#39;}\\boldsymbol{Y}\\right) = \\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\] We’ve now isolated the unknowns, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) onto one side of the equation and figured out how to use matrix algebra to obtain the regression coefficients. Quite literally, this algebra is what allows for estimation of the parameters when fitting a regression model to data. We will now work through some practical examples - staying aware that this kind of matrix algebra is being done in the background. "],["5.8-the-linear-probability-model.html", "5.8 The Linear Probability Model", " 5.8 The Linear Probability Model While we are discussing the assumptions of OLS it is worth pausing to consider a model for dichotomous outcomes: the linear probability model (LPM). In the LPM we don’t do anything fancy with a binary outcome variable. Instead, we simply apply OLS as we would with a continuous out come variable. Since we aren’t considering the normality of our outcome you might be curious how our assumptions would hold. Remembering the assumptions of OLS: \\(\\mathbb{E}(\\epsilon_{i}) = 0\\) \\(\\mathbb{E}(\\epsilon_{i}^2) = \\sigma^2\\) for all \\(i\\) (homoscedasticity) \\(\\mathbb{E}(\\epsilon_{i}\\epsilon_{j}) = 0\\) for all \\(i \\neq j\\) No perfect collinearity among \\(x\\) variables \\(\\mathbb{C}(\\epsilon_{i},x_{qi}) = 0\\) for all \\(i\\) and \\(k\\) Which assumptions are needed for consistency and asymptotic unbiasedness? No perfect collinearity among \\(x\\) variables Errors uncorrelated with all \\(x\\) variables. In regard to (4) having a dependent variable valued at \\(0,1\\) does not cause any problems. In regard to (5), again no, nothing about a dichotomous outcome violates this assumption. Therefore, in this model \\(\\mathbf{\\hat\\beta}\\) is still consistent and asymptotically unbiased. What about the remaining assumptions? Homoscedasticity Here, a dichotomous outcome does inherently violate the assumption of homoskedasticity. Why is this case? It can be shown that \\(\\mathbb{V}(\\epsilon_{i})\\) now directly depends on the value of \\(x\\) that is taken. If the \\(ith\\) person has one set of values for the \\(x\\) variables, and another individual \\(j\\) has another set, the estimates of \\(\\mathbb{V}(\\epsilon_{i})\\) and \\(\\mathbb{V}(\\epsilon_{j})\\) will differ. This can be seem by looking at the variacne of a Bernoulli random variable. This means estimate of variance of \\(\\mathbf{\\hat\\beta}\\) is no longer reliable, SEs and significance tests possibly inaccurate. However, this could be addressed using robust standard errors. It is common to look at plots of predicted values vs residuals to diagnose heteroskedasticity. Generally one would like to see a random blob of points without any discernible pattern. Here is an example of what that plot might look like for an LPM model. Each line represents a different outcome, \\(y=0\\), or \\(y=1\\). 5.8.1 Advantages of the LPM Simplicity. Regression coefficients give impact of \\(x\\) on \\(P(y_{i}=1|x)\\). Effect same regardless of value of \\(x\\) or values of other \\(x\\)s.

The slope, \\(b_1\\) is the expected difference in the outcome variable for each 1-unit difference in the predictor variable.

See for more information. 6.4.1 Interpreting Model Parameters Note that the estimate for the slope \\(b_1\\) stays the same, but the estimate for the intercept is different. This is because the variable ‘verb1_star’ equals 0 when a child has an average 1st grade verbal score. Therefore the expected value for the 2nd grade verbal score, for a child with an average 1st grade verbal score, is 25.41534. 6.4.2 Plotting Regression Line ggplot(data=wiscsub, aes(x=verb1_star,y=verb2)) + geom_point(size = 2, shape=19) + geom_smooth(method=lm,se=TRUE,fullrange=TRUE,colour=&quot;red&quot;, size=2) + labs(x= &quot;Sample-Centered Verbal Ability Grade 1&quot;, y= &quot;Verbal Ability Grade 2&quot;) + xlim(-20,20) + ylim(0,50) + #theme with white background theme_bw() + #eliminate background, gridlines, and chart border theme( plot.background = element_blank() ,panel.grid.major = element_blank() ,panel.grid.minor = element_blank() ,panel.border = element_blank() ) + #draws x and y axis line theme(axis.line = element_line(color = &#39;black&#39;)) + #set size of axis labels and titles theme(axis.text = element_text(size=12), axis.title = element_text(size=14)) ## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; Note the change of scale on the x-axis. "],["6.5-multiple-linear-regression.html", "6.5 Multiple Linear Regression", " 6.5 Multiple Linear Regression Now, let’s include a second predictor. We have information on the number of years of education for the children’s mothers, variable momed. The values in momed indicate the number of years of education each mother completed.

The slope, \\(b_2\\) is the expected difference in grade 2 verbal score for each 1 year difference in mother’s education.

Therefore, in this case, \\(b_0\\) is the expected Grade 2 verbal score for a child with an average Grade 1 verbal score (i.e. \\(verb^{*}_{1i}\\) = 0) and whose mother had an average education (i.e. \\(momed^{*}_{i}\\) = 0, \\(\\bar{momed_{i}}\\) = 10.81 years of education. \\(b_1\\) is the expected difference in the outcome for a 1-unit difference in \\(x_{1i}\\). In this example (i.e. ‘model4’), \\(b_1\\) is the expected difference in Grade 2 verbal score (outcome variable, \\(y_i\\) = \\(verb_{2i}\\)) for a 1 point difference in the Grade 1 verbal score (\\(x_{1i}\\) = \\(verb^{*}_{1i}\\)), holding constant the level of mother’s education. \\(b_2\\) is the expected difference in the outcome for a 1-unit difference in \\(x_{2i}\\). For this example (i.e. ‘model4’), \\(b_2\\) is the expected difference in Grade 2 verbal score (outcome variable, \\(y_i\\) = \\(verb_{2i}\\)) for each year difference in mother’s education (\\(x_{2i}\\) = \\(momed^{*}_i\\)), holding constant in Grade 1 verbal score. 6.5.3 A Note on Interpretation The distinguishing feature for interpretation in linear models without interactions or higher-order terms is that the effect of a given change in an independent variable is the same regardless of the value of that variable (at the start of its change) and regardless of the level of the other variables in the model. Interpretation only needs to specify which variable is changing, by how much, and that other variables are being held constant. In regard to our last example, years of mother’s education does impact the relationship between Grade 1 and 2 verbal scores. Likewise, the effect of mother’s education on Grade 1 verbal scores does not depend on Grade 1 verbal scores. Said in a different way, no matter what a child’s Grade 1 verbal score was, the effect of mother’s education on Grade 2 verbal scores is the same. Consider another model with categorical and continuous predictors, grad and verb1_star, respectively. library(&quot;ggiraphExtra&quot;) model4b &lt;- lm(verb2 ~ 1 + verb1_star + grad, data = wiscsub, na.action = na.exclude) ggPredict(model4b,se=TRUE,interactive=FALSE) Notice in the plot, whether a student’s mother graduated HS does not impact the relationship between Grade 1 and 2 verbal scores. Differences in Grade 1 and 2 verbal scores are not dependent on whether or not the mother graduated HS. Most importantly, using the coefficients themselves we can easily interpret the model parameters. "],["6.6-categorical-variable-interaction.html", "6.6 Categorical Variable Interaction", " 6.6 Categorical Variable Interaction Ok, let’s move on to the topic of an interaction which uses the product of two predictor variables as a new predictor. Working up a slightly different example with the ‘grad’ variable (whether mom graduated high school), \\[ verb_{2i} = b_01_i + b_1verb^{*}_{1i} + b_2grad_{i} + b_3(verb^{*}_{1i}grad_{i}) + \\epsilon_{i}\\] Where \\(verb^{*}_{1i}\\) is the mean-centered version of \\(verb_{1i}\\), and \\(grad_i\\) is a dummy coded variable that equals 0 if the child’s mother did not graduate high school, and equals 1 if the child’s mother did graduate high school. We did not sample-mean center \\(grad_i\\) in this example because a value of 0 already has substantive meaning for the current example (i.e. when \\(grad_i\\) equals 0, the mother did not graduate high school). 6.6.1 Interaction as Moderation Often, we describe phenomena in terms of moderation; or that the relation between two variables (i.e. \\(y_i\\) and \\(x_{1i}\\)) is moderated by a third variable (i.e. \\(x_{2i}\\)). For example, the relation between Grade 1 and Grade 2 verbal scores may be moderated by mother’s graduation status. More specifically, the relation between 1st and 2nd grade verbal score may be different for children whose mothers’ did not or did graduate from high school. The inclusion of product terms (i.e. interactions) allows for a direct investigation of a moderation hypothesis. 6.6.1.1 Choosing a Moderator When we use a product term, we should define one of the variables as the moderator and one of the variables as the predictor of interest. Let’s call \\(verb^{*}_{1i}\\) the predictor of interest, and \\(grad_{i}\\) the moderator. 6.6.2 Moderation by Categorical Variable When the moderator is a dummy variable then the form of the moderation becomes fairly simple; we will have one equation for \\(grad_{i} = 0\\), and a second equation for \\(grad_i = 1\\). 6.6.2.1 Rewriting Equation To illustrate the notion of two equations, let’s rewrite the regression equation \\[ verb_{2i} = b_01_i + b_1verb^{*}_{1i} + b_2grad_{i} + b_3(verb^{*}_{1i}grad_{i}) + \\epsilon_{i}\\] as two separate regression equations, one for mothers who graduated from highschool and one for mothers that did not. We can accomplish this by plugging in \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) into the regression equation and rearranging some of the terms. Doing so we get Equation for Students whose Mother Graduated Highschool \\[ verb_{2i} = (b_0 + b_2) + (b_1 + b_3)verb^{*}_{1i} + \\epsilon_{i}\\] Equation for Students whose Mother Did Not Graduate from Highschool \\[ verb_{2i} = b_0 + b_1verb^{*}_{1i} + \\epsilon_{i}\\] 6.6.3 Interpretation Without an interaction, our linear regression model assumes that the only difference between the regression line for each group (graduate HS vs not) is the intercept. That is, it assumes that the relationship between verbal scores at Grades 1 and 2 is the same for both groups. Children Whose Mother’s Did Not Graduate HS The expected Grade 2 verbal score for a child whose mother did not graduate high school and who had an average Grade 1 verbal score is \\(b_0\\). Also, for a child whose mother did not graduate high school, \\(b_1\\) is the expected difference in their Grade 2 verbal score for a one-point difference in their Grade 1 verbal score. Children Whose Mother’s Did Not Graduate HS The parameter estimates \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) maintain their interpretation from before. But now each of them is moderated (i.e. shifted or altered) by \\(b_2\\) or \\(b_3\\). Specifically, the expected Grade 2 verbal score for a child whose mother did graduate high school and who earned an average Grade 1 verbal score is \\(b_0 + b_2\\). And, for a child whose mother did graduate high school, \\(b_1 + b_3\\) is the expected difference in their Grade 2 verbal score for a one-point change in their Grade 1 verbal score. 6.6.4 Fit Regression Model in R OK - let’s fit the model! Note that within this model we use the code I(verb1_star * grad). This produces the interaction term within the model. The wrapper function I() indicates to R to perform this data computation as-is, otherwise we would need to perform this computation (i.e. the multiplication of verb1_star by grad) outside of the function lm(). model5 &lt;- lm(verb2 ~ 1 + verb1_star + grad + I(verb1_star*grad), data = wiscsub, na.action = na.exclude) summary(model5) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = verb2 ~ 1 + verb1_star + grad + I(verb1_star * grad), ## data = wiscsub, na.action = na.exclude) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -11.3433 -3.0761 -0.0825 2.5689 10.7289 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Also, for children whose mother did not graduate high school, a 1-point difference in their Grade 1 verbal score is expected to correspond with a 0.7861 (\\(b_1\\)) point difference in the Grade 2 verbal score. Moreover, the parameter estimates indicate that, for children whose mother did graduate high school, the expected Grade 2 verbal score for a child that earned an average Grade 1 verbal score is 25.2663 + 1.4632 = 26.7295 (\\(b_0 + b_2\\)). Also, for children whose mother graduated high school, a 1-point difference in their Grade 1 verbal score is expected to correspond with a (\\(b_1 + b_3\\)) = 0.7861 - 0.2430 = 0.5431 point difference in the Grade 2 verbal score. Even though the interaction is not significant, we can plot it for illustrating the moderation effect: #plot of moderation ggplot(data=wiscsub, aes(y=verb2,x=verb1_star, color = factor(grad))) + geom_jitter() + stat_smooth(method=&#39;lm&#39;, se=TRUE, fullrange=TRUE) + xlab(&quot;1st Grade Verbal Score&quot;) + ylab(&quot;2nd Grade Verbal Score&quot;) + guides(color=guide_legend(title=&quot;HS Grad&quot;)) + theme_bw() ## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; The example from ‘model5’ contained an interaction using a dummy variable (i.e., \\(grad_i\\)). Interactions may also occur between two continuous variables (i.e., \\(verb^{*}_{1i}\\) and \\(momed^{*}_{i}\\)). We will not cover here, but note that it is still very useful to consider and communicate those interactions as moderation. There are many resources on interactions of two (or more) continuous variables. "]]
