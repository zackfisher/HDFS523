## Statistical Control


**Randomized experiments often considered the gold standard in scientific research.However, it is often infeasible, difficult or impossible to manipulate the putative effect of interest**:


* cannot randomly resettle individuals into different strata of society
* cannot assign couples to stay married or get a divorce
* cannot randomize children to different levels of adversity


**Researchers have employed a number of different strategies in response to the limitations of observational data**: 

* surrogate interventions
    + item the real-life cause of interest cannot be manipulated, often a proxy can be randomized in the lab.
* avoiding causal language
    + item write about associations and relationships despite substantive question about causal effects
* statistical control
    + include control variables in analysis but choice of variables often difficult and statistical control itself insufficient


## Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)

**Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are another approach that can be used to examine causal inferences from observational data.**

* They were developed primarily by the computer scientist Judea Pearl 
* DAGs provide a visual representation of causal assumptions.
* Some overlap with structural equation models (SEMs).


**Importantly, DAGs can provide insights on**

* What variables should be controlled for?
* What variables should not be controlled for?
* In what situations might control worsen causal inference?


### Introduction to DAGs

**Below is a simple DAG depicting a model in which the relationship between maltreatment externalizing is confounded by a common cause, income.**


```{r,echo=FALSE,engine='tikz',fig.ext=if (knitr:::is_latex_output()) 'pdf' else 'png'}
\usetikzlibrary{shapes,decorations,arrows,calc,arrows.meta,fit,positioning}
\tikzset{
    -Latex,auto,node distance =1 cm and 1 cm,semithick,
    state/.style ={ellipse, draw, minimum width = 0.7 cm},
    point/.style = {circle, draw, inner sep=0.04cm,fill,node contents={}},
    bidirected/.style={Latex-Latex,dashed},
    el/.style = {inner sep=2pt, align=left, sloped}
}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[draw, align=center] (1) at (0,0) {Child\\Maltreatment};
    \node[draw, align=center] (2) at (5,0) {Child's\\Externalizing};
    \node[draw, align=center] (3) at (2.5,-2) {Family\\Income};
    \path (1) edge  (2);
    \path (3) edge (1);
    \path (3) edge (2);
\end{tikzpicture}
```


DAGs consist of **nodes** (variables) and **arrows** (edges) between these nodes, which reflect causal relationships.


 It is assumed that manipulation of a variable at which an arrow begins (e.g., a manipulation of child maltreatment with income held constant) would change the variable at the end of the arrow (e.g., externalizing).
 
 
### Introduction to DAGs: Paths
 
 From these two simple building blocks—**nodes** and **arrows**—one can visualize more complex situations and trace paths from variable to variable:
 
 
```{r,echo=FALSE,engine='tikz',fig.ext=if (knitr:::is_latex_output()) 'pdf' else 'png'}
\usetikzlibrary{shapes,decorations,arrows,calc,arrows.meta,fit,positioning}
\tikzset{
    -Latex,auto,node distance =1 cm and 1 cm,semithick,
    state/.style ={ellipse, draw, minimum width = 0.7 cm},
    point/.style = {circle, draw, inner sep=0.04cm,fill,node contents={}},
    bidirected/.style={Latex-Latex,dashed},
    el/.style = {inner sep=2pt, align=left, sloped}
}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[draw, align=center] (1) at (0,0) {Child\\Maltreatment};
    \node[draw, align=center] (2) at (5,0) {Child's\\Externalizing};
    \node[draw, align=center] (3) at (2.5,-2) {Family\\Income};
    \node[draw, align=center] (4) at (0,-1.5) {Family\\Support};
    \path (1) edge  (2);
    \path (3) edge (1);
    \path (3) edge (2);
    \path (4) edge (1);
    \path (3) edge (4);
\end{tikzpicture}
```

**Paths**

* A simple path leads just from one node to another (income → stress).
* Paths can also contain multiple nodes:
    + income → stress → child maltreatment
* Paths can also travel against the direction indicated by arrows
    + child maltreatment ← stress ← income → externalizing


### Introduction to DAGs: Chains

 
```{r,echo=FALSE,engine='tikz',fig.ext=if (knitr:::is_latex_output()) 'pdf' else 'png'}
\usetikzlibrary{shapes,decorations,arrows,calc,arrows.meta,fit,positioning}
\tikzset{
    -Latex,auto,node distance =1 cm and 1 cm,semithick,
    state/.style ={ellipse, draw, minimum width = 0.7 cm},
    point/.style = {circle, draw, inner sep=0.04cm,fill,node contents={}},
    bidirected/.style={Latex-Latex,dashed},
    el/.style = {inner sep=2pt, align=left, sloped}
}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[draw, align=center] (1) at (0,0) {Child\\Maltreatment};
    \node[draw, align=center] (2) at (5,0) {Child's\\Externalizing};
    \node[draw, align=center] (3) at (2.5,-2) {Family\\Income};
    \node[draw, align=center] (4) at (0,-1.5) {Family\\Support};
    \path[dashed,red] (1) edge  (2);
    \path[dashed,red] (3) edge (1);
    \path (3) edge (2);
    \path (4) edge (1);
    \path (3) edge (4);
\end{tikzpicture}
```


**Chains**

* Chains have the structure A → B → C.
* Chains can transmit an association between the beginning and end nodes. 
    + If income causally affects child maltreatment, and child maltreatment causally affects externalizing, then income and externalizing can be correlated.
    
### Introduction to DAGs: Descendants and Ancestors

 
```{r,echo=FALSE,engine='tikz',fig.ext=if (knitr:::is_latex_output()) 'pdf' else 'png'}
\usetikzlibrary{shapes,decorations,arrows,calc,arrows.meta,fit,positioning}
\tikzset{
    -Latex,auto,node distance =1 cm and 1 cm,semithick,
    state/.style ={ellipse, draw, minimum width = 0.7 cm},
    point/.style = {circle, draw, inner sep=0.04cm,fill,node contents={}},
    bidirected/.style={Latex-Latex,dashed},
    el/.style = {inner sep=2pt, align=left, sloped}
}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[draw, align=center] (1) at (0,0) {Child\\Maltreatment};
    \node[draw, align=center] (2) at (5,0) {Child's\\Externalizing};
    \node[draw, align=center] (3) at (2.5,-2) {Family\\Income};
    \node[draw, align=center] (4) at (0,-1.5) {Family\\Support};
    \path (1) edge  (2);
    \path (3) edge (1);
    \path (3) edge (2);
    \path (4) edge (1);
    \path (3) edge (4);
\end{tikzpicture}
```


**Chains: Descendants and Ancestors**

* Along a chain, variables that are directly or indirectly causally affected by a certain variable are called its descendants
    + externalizing is a descendant of child maltreatment
* Variables that directly or indirectly affect a certain variable are considered its ancestors.
    + income is an ancestor of support, child maltreatment and internalizing
    
    
### Introduction to DAGs: Forks

```{r,echo=FALSE,engine='tikz',fig.ext=if (knitr:::is_latex_output()) 'pdf' else 'png'}
\usetikzlibrary{shapes,decorations,arrows,calc,arrows.meta,fit,positioning}
\tikzset{
    -Latex,auto,node distance =1 cm and 1 cm,semithick,
    state/.style ={ellipse, draw, minimum width = 0.7 cm},
    point/.style = {circle, draw, inner sep=0.04cm,fill,node contents={}},
    bidirected/.style={Latex-Latex,dashed},
    el/.style = {inner sep=2pt, align=left, sloped}
}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[draw, align=center] (1) at (0,0) {Child\\Maltreatment};
    \node[draw, align=center] (2) at (5,0) {Child's\\Externalizing};
    \node[draw, align=center] (3) at (2.5,-2) {Family\\Income};
    \node[draw, align=center] (4) at (0,-1.5) {Family\\Support};
    \path (1) edge  (2);
    \path[dashed,red] (3) edge (1);
    \path[dashed,red] (3) edge (2);
    \path (4) edge (1);
    \path (3) edge (4);
\end{tikzpicture}
```

**Forks**

* Forks have the structure A ← B → C.
* A fork can transmit an association, but it is not causal.
    + In isolation, this fork indicates that child maltreatment and externalizing may be correlated because they share a common cause, income.
* Forks are the causal structure most relevant for the phenomenon of confounding.


### Introduction to DAGs: Inverted Forks

```{r,echo=FALSE,engine='tikz',fig.ext=if (knitr:::is_latex_output()) 'pdf' else 'png'}
\usetikzlibrary{shapes,decorations,arrows,calc,arrows.meta,fit,positioning}
\tikzset{
    -Latex,auto,node distance =1 cm and 1 cm,semithick,
    state/.style ={ellipse, draw, minimum width = 0.7 cm},
    point/.style = {circle, draw, inner sep=0.04cm,fill,node contents={}},
    bidirected/.style={Latex-Latex,dashed},
    el/.style = {inner sep=2pt, align=left, sloped}
}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[draw, align=center] (1) at (0,0) {Child\\Maltreatment};
    \node[draw, align=center] (2) at (5,0) {Child's\\Externalizing};
    \node[draw, align=center] (3) at (2.5,-2) {Family\\Income};
    \node[draw, align=center] (4) at (0,-1.5) {Family\\Support};
    \path[dashed,red] (1) edge  (2);
    \path (3) edge (1);
    \path[dashed,red] (3) edge (2);
    \path (4) edge (1);
    \path (3) edge (4);
\end{tikzpicture}
```


**Inverted Forks**

* Inverted forks have the structure A → B ← C.
* An inverted fork does not transmit an association.
    + In isolation, If child maltreatment and income both affect externalizing, this does not imply that they are in any way correlated.
* Inverted forks are relevant to the problem of collider bias.

### Introduction to DAGs: Acyclicity

```{r,echo=FALSE,engine='tikz',fig.ext=if (knitr:::is_latex_output()) 'pdf' else 'png'}
\usetikzlibrary{shapes,decorations,arrows,calc,arrows.meta,fit,positioning}
\tikzset{
    -Latex,auto,node distance =1 cm and 1 cm,semithick,
    state/.style ={ellipse, draw, minimum width = 0.7 cm},
    point/.style = {circle, draw, inner sep=0.04cm,fill,node contents={}},
    bidirected/.style={Latex-Latex,dashed},
    el/.style = {inner sep=2pt, align=left, sloped}
}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[draw, align=center] (1) at (0,0) {Child\\Maltreatment};
    \node[draw, align=center] (2) at (5,0) {Child's\\Externalizing};
    \node[draw, align=center] (3) at (2.5,-2) {Family\\Income};
    \node[draw, align=center] (4) at (0,-1.5) {Family\\Support};
    \path[dashed,red] (1) edge  (2);
    \path (3) edge (1);
    \path[dashed,red] (3) edge (2);
    \path (4) edge (1);
    \path (3) edge (4);
\end{tikzpicture}
```


**Acyclicity**

* DAGs are acyclic because they do not allow for cyclic paths in which variables become their own ancestors.
    + a variable cannot causally affect itself
* Developmental systems often contain feedback loops and reciprocal relationships.
    + Often feedback loops can be modeled in a DAG by taking the temporal order into account and adding nodes for repeated measures.

## Statistical Control Done Right

**The central problem of observational data is confounding**:

* the presence of a common cause that lurks behind the potential cause of interest and the outcome of interest. 


**A confounding influence can introduce what is often called a spurious correlation, which ought not to be confused with a causal effect.**

* The extraordinarily influence of randomized experiments in testing causal inferences is based on the simple fact that if the independent variable is randomly assigned—for example, by the flip of a coin—by design it cannot share a common cause with the outcome.

**How can a DAG be used to figure out how to remove all such noncausal associations so that only the true causal effect remains?**

### Building a DAG

**To derive a valid causal conclusion, one must ensure the DAG includes everything that is relevant to the causal effect of interest. What is missing**


```{r,echo=FALSE,engine='tikz',fig.ext=if (knitr:::is_latex_output()) 'pdf' else 'png'}
\usetikzlibrary{shapes,decorations,arrows,calc,arrows.meta,fit,positioning}
\tikzset{
    -Latex,auto,node distance =1 cm and 1 cm,semithick,
    state/.style ={ellipse, draw, minimum width = 0.7 cm},
    point/.style = {circle, draw, inner sep=0.04cm,fill,node contents={}},
    bidirected/.style={Latex-Latex,dashed},
    el/.style = {inner sep=2pt, align=left, sloped}
}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[draw, align=center] (1) at (0,0) {Child\\Maltreatment};
    \node[draw, align=center] (2) at (5,0) {Child's\\Externalizing};
    \node[draw, align=center] (3) at (2.5,-2) {Family\\Income};
    \node[draw, align=center] (4) at (0,-1.5) {Family\\Support};
    \path[dashed,red] (1) edge  (2);
    \path (3) edge (1);
    \path[dashed,red] (3) edge (2);
    \path (4) edge (1);
    \path (3) edge (4);
\end{tikzpicture}
```


If we want to derive a valid causal conclusion, we need to build a causal DAG that is complete because it includes all common causes of all pairs of variables that are already included in the DAG (Spirtes, Glymour, & Scheines, 2000). 

That is, any additional variable that either directly or indirectly causally affects at least two variables already included in the DAG should be included.


### Building a DAG: Back-Door Paths

**After a DAG is built, back-door paths can be discerned.**

Back-door paths are all paths that start with an arrow pointing to the independent variable and end with an arrow pointing to the dependent variable.


```{r,echo=FALSE,engine='tikz',fig.ext=if (knitr:::is_latex_output()) 'pdf' else 'png'}
\usetikzlibrary{shapes,decorations,arrows,calc,arrows.meta,fit,positioning}
\tikzset{
    -Latex,auto,node distance =1 cm and 1 cm,semithick,
    state/.style ={ellipse, draw, minimum width = 0.7 cm},
    point/.style = {circle, draw, inner sep=0.04cm,fill,node contents={}},
    bidirected/.style={Latex-Latex,dashed},
    el/.style = {inner sep=2pt, align=left, sloped}
}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[draw, align=center] (1) at (0,0) {Child\\Maltreatment};
    \node[draw, align=center] (2) at (5,0) {Child's\\Externalizing};
    \node[draw, align=center] (3) at (2.5,-2) {Family\\Income};
    \node[draw, align=center] (4) at (0,-1.5) {Family\\Support};
    \path (1) edge  (2);
    \path (3) edge (1);
    \path (3) edge (2);
    \path (4) edge (1);
    \path (3) edge (4);
\end{tikzpicture}
```

If we plan to investigate the causal relationship between child maltreatment and internalizing what are the back-door paths in our example DAG?


**Back-Door Paths**

* child maltreatment ← support ← income → externalizing
* child maltreatment ← income → externalizing

**Back-Door Problems**

* Back-door paths are problematic whenever they transmit an association. 
* In this case, both backdoor paths consist of only chains and forks, thus, these two back-door paths are open, and they can transmit a spurious association.

**Back-Door Solutions**

* The zero-order correlation between child maltreatment and externalizing is a mix of the true causal effect (child maltreatment → externalizing) of interest plus any noncausal association transmitted by the two back-door paths.
* To remove the undesirable noncausal association, we must block the two back-door paths.

**Blocking Back-Door Paths**

**The purpose of third-variable control is to block open back-door paths.**

* If all back-door paths between the independent and dependent variables can be blocked, then the causal effect connecting the independent and dependent variables can be identified.

* Such a causal effect would be considered identifiable, always under the assumption that the DAG captures the true underlying causal web.

* A back-door path can be blocked by “cutting” the transmission of association at any point in the path by statistically controlling a node.


**What variables would we want to control for to identify the causal effect of child maltreatment on externalizing?**

```{r,echo=FALSE,engine='tikz',fig.ext=if (knitr:::is_latex_output()) 'pdf' else 'png'}
\usetikzlibrary{shapes,decorations,arrows,calc,arrows.meta,fit,positioning}
\tikzset{
    -Latex,auto,node distance =1 cm and 1 cm,semithick,
    state/.style ={ellipse, draw, minimum width = 0.7 cm},
    point/.style = {circle, draw, inner sep=0.04cm,fill,node contents={}},
    bidirected/.style={Latex-Latex,dashed},
    el/.style = {inner sep=2pt, align=left, sloped}
}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[draw, align=center] (1) at (0,0) {Child\\Maltreatment};
    \node[draw, align=center] (2) at (5,0) {Child's\\Externalizing};
    \node[draw, align=center] (3) at (2.5,-2) {Family\\Income};
    \node[draw, align=center] (4) at (0,-1.5) {Family\\Support};
    \path (1) edge  (2);
    \path (3) edge (1);
    \path (3) edge (2);
    \path (4) edge (1);
    \path (3) edge (4);
\end{tikzpicture}
```

## Statistical Control Gone Wrong

In certain fields, it has become common practice to include as many covariates as possible.

Unfortunately, it is not true that simply adding more covariates will improve the estimate of a causal effect. 

**There are two types of variables that researchers should not control for without taking into account potential negative side effects: colliders and mediators.**

Whereas confounders causally affect the independent variable of interest, colliders and mediators are causally affected by the independent variable. 

### Collider Bias

A collider for a certain pair of variables is any variable that is causally influenced by both of them.

**Controlling for, or conditioning analysis on, such a variable (or any of its descendants) can introduce a spurious (i.e., noncausal) association between its causes.**

In DAG terminology, a collider is the variable in the middle of an inverted fork, for example, variable B in A → B ← C.

The collider variable normally blocks the path, but when one controls for it, a spurious association between A and C can arise. 

### Conditioning on a Collider

**Thought Experiment**

Imagine we are interested in the effect of child maltreatment on personality features, such as extroversion.

For this thought experiment, let us assume that there is actually no causal effect of child maltreatment on extroversion.

To investigate the association, we look at all individuals with substantiated claims of maltreatment via CPS.

**We find a sizable negative association: those who experienced more maltreatment show less extroversion and vice versa.**

Suppose we then realize bias might be an issue and conduct a follow-up study on individuals who self-report experiencing maltreatment but do not have CPS involvement.

**Again we find a sizable negative association.**

By assessing substantiated and unsubstantiated cases separately, we have stratified, or conditioned, our analyses by CPS involvement. 

However, let's assume that exposure to child maltreatment and extroversion are likely to be associated with CPS contact.

In the simplest case, both have a positive effect: 

* With increasing child maltreatment, the likelihood of CPS involvement increases.
* With increasing extroversion, the likelihood of CPS involvement increases. 


```{r,echo=FALSE,engine='tikz',fig.ext=if (knitr:::is_latex_output()) 'pdf' else 'png'}
\usetikzlibrary{shapes,decorations,arrows,calc,arrows.meta,fit,positioning}
\tikzset{
    -Latex,auto,node distance =1 cm and 1 cm,semithick,
    state/.style ={ellipse, draw, minimum width = 0.7 cm},
    point/.style = {circle, draw, inner sep=0.04cm,fill,node contents={}},
    bidirected/.style={Latex-Latex,dashed},
    el/.style = {inner sep=2pt, align=left, sloped}
}
    
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[draw, align=center] (1) at (0,0) {Child\\Maltreatment};
    \node[draw, align=center] (2) at (0,-2) {Extroversion};
    \node[draw, align=center] (3) at (3,-1) {CPS\\Involvement};
    \path (1) edge  (2);
    \path (1) edge (3);
    \path (2) edge (3);
\end{tikzpicture}
```

**In our thought experiment, there is no association between child maltreatment and extroversion if all individuals—with and without CPS involvement—are considered simultaneously without statistical control (of the collider or any descendants)**

![Collider Bias](imgs/collider_bias.jpg)


The spurious negative correlation emerges only when the joint outcome of the two variables of interest is controlled for. 

This observation generalizes to similar situations in which selection into a group is based on multiple desirable features: 

* Group membership is a collider variable, and conditioning analysis on it will introduce or exaggerate trade-offs between desirable features.


### Avoiding Collider Bias

Avoiding collider bias requires two steps.

* One must be aware of the collider variable, and this may entail using a DAG to identify colliders that exist between and independent variable and outcome.

* One must be able to run analyses that are not conditional on the collider. This entails not controlling for the collider when examining the main effect of interest.

**Thought Experiment**

* In our thought experiment, we must include individuals involved and not involved with CPS

* Outside of thought experiments, one might often be unaware of collider variables or collect data in such a way that collider bias is built in.


### Variations on Collider Bias: Nonresponse Bias

Nonresponse bias occurs if, for example, a researcher analyzes only completed questionnaires, and the variables of interest are associated with questionnaire completion.

Assume that we are interested in the association between grit and intelligence, and our assessment ends up being very burdensome.

* Both grit and intelligence make it easier for respondents to push through and complete the assessment.
* Questionnaire completion is thus a collider between grit and intelligence.
* Although there might be no association between grit and intelligence in the population, we might find a spurious negative association if we analyze only completed questionnaires.
    + completers low on intelligence and high levels of grit
    + completers low on grit and high on intellgence
    + noncompleter low on both variables less likely to finish 

### Controlling for Mediators

Overcontrol bias is another example of statistical control hurting instead of helping: 


* If mediating variables are controlled for, the very processes of interest are controlled away.

Consider our previous example, now slightly modified:

```{r,echo=FALSE,engine='tikz',fig.ext=if (knitr:::is_latex_output()) 'pdf' else 'png'}
\usetikzlibrary{shapes,decorations,arrows,calc,arrows.meta,fit,positioning}
\tikzset{
    -Latex,auto,node distance =1 cm and 1 cm,semithick,
    state/.style ={ellipse, draw, minimum width = 0.7 cm},
    point/.style = {circle, draw, inner sep=0.04cm,fill,node contents={}},
    bidirected/.style={Latex-Latex,dashed},
    el/.style = {inner sep=2pt, align=left, sloped}
}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[draw, align=center] (1) at (0,0) {Child\\Maltreatment};

    \node[draw, align=center] (3) at (2.5,-2) {Income\\(as Child)};
    \node[draw, align=center] (4) at (0,-1) {Stress};
    \node[draw, align=center] (5) at (2.5,2) {Income\\(as Adult)};
    \node (6) at (6,1) {U};
    \path (1) edge  (2);
    \path (3) edge (1);
    \path (3) edge (2);

    \path (3) edge (4);
     \path (1) edge (5);
     \path (5) edge (2);
     \path (6) edge (5);
     \path (6) edge (2);
\end{tikzpicture}
```
