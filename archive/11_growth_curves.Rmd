In this chapter we work through basics of growth modeling. We describe the data, run some individual level models, and work through no-growth and linear growth modeling examples. We then expand on that model in two ways. We add a predictor - to get the conditional growth model and we change the time-metric - to illustrate how alternative time metrics facilitate different interpretations. 

## Introduction

With growth curve modeling we are typically interested in anwsering some basic questions about change:

- How does the construct change over time/age?
- Are there interindividual differences in the level of a process? 
- Are there interindividual differences in the rate of change over time?
- How is the level of the construct (at a specific time) related to the rate of change?
- What interindividual characteristic relate to interindividual differences in the level and/or rate of change?
- How are changes in one variable associated with changes in another variable?
- Are there time-dependent relationships in the development of two or more variables?


## Data Preparation and Description

### Loading libraries used in this script.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(psych)  #for basic functions
library(ggplot2)  #for plotting
library(data.table) #for fast data management
library(nlme) #for mixed effects models
library(plyr) #for data management
library(see)
library(ggeffects)
```

For our examples, we use 4-occasion WISC data. Load the repeated measures data. 

```{r}
filepath <- "https://quantdev.ssri.psu.edu/sites/qdev/files/wisc3raw.csv"
wisc3raw <- read.csv(file=url(filepath),header=TRUE)
```

Subsetting to the variables of interest. Specifically, we include the `id` variable; the repeated measures outcome variables `verb1`, `verb2`, `verb4`, `verb6`; and the predictors `grad` and `momed` variables.

```{r}
varnames <- c("id","verb1","verb2","verb4","verb6","grad","momed")
wiscsub <- wisc3raw[ ,varnames]
describe(wiscsub)
```

Multilevel modeling analyses typically require a tall (long) data set. So, we reshape from wide to tall:

```{r}
verblong <- reshape(
  data=wiscsub, 
  varying=c("verb1","verb2","verb4","verb6"), 
  timevar="grade", 
  idvar="id", 
  direction="long", 
  sep=""
)
verblong <- verblong[order(verblong$id,verblong$grade),c("id","grade","verb","grad","momed")]
head(verblong,12)
```



## Individual Growth Models

To introduce growth modeling we will begin with data from a single individual. Let's make a dataset with just 1 person of interest, `id = 23`,

```{r}
verb_id23 <- verblong[which(verblong$id == 23), ]
```

### Visualizing Individual Change

Let's make a plot of this person's data,

```{r}
ggplot(data = verb_id23, aes(x = grade, y = verb, group = id)) +
  geom_point() + 
  xlab("Grade") + 
  ylab("WISC Verbal Score") + ylim(0,100) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,6,by=1)) +
  theme_classic()
```

We could connect the dots to see time-adjacent changes.

```{r}
ggplot(data = verb_id23, aes(x = grade, y = verb, group = id)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Grade") + 
  ylab("WISC Verbal Score") + ylim(0,100) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,6,by=1)) +
  theme_classic()
```


We could also *smooth* over the repeated measuring using a line of best fit for this individual.

```{r}
ggplot(data = verb_id23, aes(x = grade, y = verb, group = id)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE,colour="red", size=1) +
  xlab("Grade") + 
  ylab("WISC Verbal Score") + ylim(0,100) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,6,by=1)) +
  theme_classic()
```

Notice, we can summarize this line with two pieces of information, (1) an intercept, and (2) a slope, each unique to individual 23. 

### Multiple Individuals

Let's do an individual regression with time as a predictor. Conceptually, this is a model of intraindividual change corresponding to the plot above.

```{r}
#regress verb on grade 
linear_id23 <- lm(formula = verb ~ 1 + grade, data = verb_id23, na.action=na.exclude)
#show results
summary(linear_id23) 
```

Let's save the 3 parameters into objects and look at them.

```{r}
id23_reg_linear <- as.list(coef(linear_id23))
id23_reg_linear
```

**Now let's do the same thing for all the persons.**

We do this in a speedy way using the `data.table` package.

```{r}
#converting to a data.table object
verblong_dt <- data.table(verblong)

#collecting regression output by id 
indiv_reg <- verblong_dt[,c(
  reg_1 = as.list(coef(lm(verb ~ grade)))
),by=id]
```

Let's look at the moments of the parameters

```{r}
#converting back to data.frame 
names(indiv_reg)
indiv_reg_data <- as.data.frame(indiv_reg)

#descriptives
describe(indiv_reg_data[-1])
#correlations among parameters
cor(indiv_reg_data[-1], use="complete.obs",method="pearson")
#pairs in the psych library
pairs.panels(indiv_reg_data[-1])
```

Here, each person has 2 *scores* (intercept + slope) from the individual-level regression models. Now, let's plot some of the individual regressions

```{r}
#making intraindividual change plot
ggplot(data = verblong[which(verblong$id < 30),], aes(x = grade, y = verb, group = id)) +
  geom_smooth(method=lm,se=FALSE,colour="red", size=1) +
  xlab("Grade") + 
  ylab("WISC Verbal Score") + ylim(0,100) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,6,by=1)) +
  theme_classic()
```

The characteristics of the latent trajectories are captured in two ways:

1. **Trajectory Means**:
  - The average value of the parameters governing the growth trajectory, pooled over the all individuals in the sample. This is the mean starting point and mean rate of change for the sample. These are often called fixed effects.
2. **Trajectory Variances**: 
  - The variability of individual cases around the mean trajectory parameters. This is the individual variability in starting point and rate of change over time. Larger variances reflect larger variability in growth. These are often called random effects.

To recap, means captures overall values of parameters that define growth. Variances capture individual variability in those parameters. 


Let's move to our more familiar framework for handling the analysis of "collections" of regressions.

## Unconditional Means Model

We will begin by fitting the unconditional means model, or *no growth* model to the 4-ocasion WISC data.

We use the `nlme` package for fitting *mixed effects* models, also known as multilevel (MLM) or hierarchical linear models (HLM).

Specifically, we use the `lme()` function to fits the MLMs:
- The 'fixed' argument takes the fixed model
- The 'random' argument takes the random model
- The 'data' argument specifies the data sources
- The 'na.action' argument specifies how to handle missing data


![Baseline Model](imgs/model01.jpg)

The Unconditional Means model contains a fixed and random intercept only. You can use the constant `1` to designate that only intercepts are being modeled.

```{r}
um_fit <- lme(
  fixed= verb ~ 1, 
  random = ~ 1|id, 
  data = verblong,
  na.action = na.exclude,
  method = "ML"
)

summary(um_fit)
```

Let's extract the random effects with the `VarCorr()` function

```{r}
VarCorr(um_fit)
```

We can compute the intra-class correlation (ICC) as the ratio of the random intercept variance (between-person) to the total variance (between + within), that includes the error.

First let's store the variance estimates, which will be the first column of the `VarCorr` object (see above).

```{r}
RandomEffects <- as.numeric(VarCorr(um_fit)[,1])
RandomEffects
```

Next let's compute the ICC. It is the ratio of the random intercept variance (between-person var) over the total variance (between + within var).

```{r}
ICC_between <- RandomEffects[1]/(RandomEffects[1]+RandomEffects[2]) 
ICC_between
```

From the results we seeM there is lots of within-person variance for us to explain.  

- between-person variance = $9.2\%$   
- within-person variance = $100 - 9.2 = 91.8\%$   
 
### Predicted Trajectories

Place individual predictions and residuals from the unconditional means model `um_fit` into the dataframe

```{r}
verblong$pred_um <- predict(um_fit)
verblong$resid_um <- residuals(um_fit)
head(verblong)
```

We can make plots of the model outputs. Here we plot the between-person differences in levels ($9\%$).
```{r}

ggplot(data = verblong, aes(x = grade, y = pred_um, group = id)) +
  ggtitle("Unconditional Means Model") +
#  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Grade") + 
  ylab("PREDICTED WISC Verbal Score") + ylim(0,100) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,6,by=1)) +
  theme_classic()
```


Here we plot the between-person differences in levels ($91\%$).

```{r}
#plotting RESIDUAL intraindividual change
ggplot(data = verblong, aes(x = grade, y = resid_um, group = id)) +
  ggtitle("Unconditional Means Model (residuals)") +
#  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Grade") + 
  ylab("RESIDUAL WISC Verbal Score") + #ylim(0,100) + Note the removal of limits on y-axis
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,6,by=1)) +
  theme_classic()
```

We cab also plot the predicted intraindividual change alongside the mean trajectory.

```{r}
fun_um <- function(x) { 30.33951 + 0*x }
ggplot(data = verblong, aes(x = grade, y = pred_um, group = id)) +
  ggtitle("Unconditional Means Model") +
  #  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Grade") + 
  ylab("PREDICTED WISC Verbal Score") + ylim(0,100) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,6,by=1)) +
  stat_function(fun=fun_um, color="red", size = 2) +
  theme_classic()
```

Since it is often too messy to plot all individuals we can also subset the plot.

```{r}
randomsample <- sample(verblong$id,20)
ggplot(data = verblong[verblong$id %in% randomsample,], aes(x = grade, y = pred_um, group = id)) +
  ggtitle("Unconditional Means Model") +
  #  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Grade") + 
  ylab("PREDICTED WISC Verbal Score") + ylim(0,100) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,6,by=1)) +
  stat_function(fun=fun_um, color="red", size = 2)
```


## Linear Growth Model

Now let's add in `grade` as a (time-varying) predictor. We look at the linear relation between the time variable (grade) and the outcome variable (verb).


### Random Intercept Model

My naming convention for objects here is: fixed linear (fl) and random intercept (ri)
```{r}
fl_ri_fit <- lme(
  fixed = verb ~ 1 + grade, 
  random = ~ 1|id, 
  data=verblong,
  na.action = na.exclude,
  method = "ML"
)
summary(fl_ri_fit)
```

Let's look at the predicted trajectories from this model

```{r}
#Place individual predictions and residuals into the dataframe
verblong$pred_fl_ri <- predict(fl_ri_fit)
verblong$resid_fl_ri <- residuals(fl_ri_fit)
#Create a function for the mean trajectory
fun_fl_ri <- function(x) { 15.15099 + 4.67339*x }

#plotting PREDICTED intraindividual change
ggplot(data = verblong, aes(x = grade, y = pred_fl_ri, group = id)) +
  ggtitle("Fixed Linear, Random Intercept") +
  #  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Grade") + 
  ylab("PREDICTED WISC Verbal Score") + ylim(0,100) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,6,by=1)) + 
  stat_function(fun=fun_fl_ri, color="red", size = 2) +
  theme_classic()
```

Note how all the lines are parallel. This imples individual variability in starting point *but* a constant rate of change over time.

Let's look at the residuals.
```{r}
ggplot(data = verblong, aes(x = grade, y = resid_fl_ri, group = id)) +
  ggtitle("Fixed Linear, Random Intercept") +
  #  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Grade") + 
  ylab("RESIDUAL WISC Verbal Score") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,6,by=1)) +
  theme_classic()
```

Note the differences in variance. 

### Random Intercept and Slopes Model

![Linear Growth Model](imgs/model02.jpg)

```{r}
fl_rl_fit <- lme(
  fixed = verb ~ 1 + grade, 
  random = ~ 1 + grade|id, 
  data=verblong,
  na.action = na.exclude,
  method = "ML"
)
summary(fl_rl_fit)
```

We can take a look at the ICCs to see if we are doing any better explaining the within-person variance.

```{r}
RandomEffects <- as.numeric(VarCorr(fl_rl_fit)[,1])
ICC_between <- sum(RandomEffects[1:2])/sum(RandomEffects) 
ICC_between
```

Let's look at the predicted trajectories from this model. We can start by saving the predicted trajectories and residuals into our dataframe.

```{r}
verblong$pred_fl_rl <- predict(fl_rl_fit)
verblong$resid_fl_rl <- residuals(fl_rl_fit)
```

Next, we make a small function to plot the mean trajectory. Now we use the `fixedf()` function directly rather than type the numbers manually from the output. 

```{r}
#Create a function for the prototype
#fun_fl_rl <- function(x) {
#  15.15099 + 4.67339*x
#}

fun_fl_rl <- function(x) {
  fixef(fl_rl_fit)[[1]] + fixef(fl_rl_fit)[[2]]*x
}

#plotting PREDICTED intraindividual change
ggplot(data = verblong, aes(x = grade, y = pred_fl_rl, group = id)) +
  ggtitle("Fixed Linear, Random Linear") +
  #  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Grade") + 
  ylab("PREDICTED WISC Verbal Score") + ylim(0,100) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,6,by=1)) + 
  stat_function(fun=fun_fl_rl, color="red", size = 2) +
  theme_classic()
```

Note how the lines are no longer parallel. We now have a model that implies individual variability in the starting point and rate of change.

We can also plot the residuals.

```{r}
#plotting RESIDUAL intraindividual change
ggplot(data = verblong, aes(x = grade, y = resid_fl_rl, group = id)) +
  ggtitle("Fixed Linear, Random Linear") +
  #  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Grade") + 
  ylab("RESIDUAL WISC Verbal Score") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,6,by=1)) +
  theme_classic()
```

This model did a bit better on getting the residual variances similar at all grades (in line with assumptions).

### Model Comparison

Let's test the significance of having random slopes. We compare models by applying `anova()` function to examine difference in fit between the two nested models. 

```{r}
anova(fl_ri_fit, fl_rl_fit)
```

From the test results we see they are different. This provides a significance test for the variance and covariance (2 degrees of freedom).


### MLM and Individual Models

Remember, earlier, we ran individual-level regressions.

```{r}
head(indiv_reg_data,12) 
```

Let's also obtain individual-level *estimates* from the MLM model.

```{r}
FE <- fixef(fl_rl_fit) # fixed effects
FE
RE <- ranef(fl_rl_fit) # random effects
head(RE)
```

We add the fixed effect and random effect parameters together to get analogues of the individual-level parameters.

```{r}
#Individual intercepts (MLM model based)
MLM_intercept <- FE[1] + RE[,1]
#Individual slopes (MLM model based)
MLM_grade <- FE[2] + RE[,2]
```

Let's combine the individual regression intercepts and slopes and the model based intercepts and slopes together in order to compare.

```{r}
indiv_parm_combined <- cbind(MLM_intercept,MLM_grade,indiv_reg_data[,2:3])
head(indiv_parm_combined)
```

Look at the descriptives statistics.

```{r}
describe(indiv_parm_combined)
round(cor(indiv_parm_combined),2)
pairs.panels(indiv_parm_combined)
```


Let's compare the two predictions. What do you notice?

```{r}
library(see)
#plotting PREDICTED intraindividual change
GCMpred = ggplot(data = verblong, aes(x = grade, y = pred_fl_rl, group = id)) +
  ggtitle("Fixed Linear, Random Linear") +
  #  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Grade") + 
  ylab("PREDICTED WISC Verbal Score") + ylim(0,100) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,6,by=1)) + 
  stat_function(fun=fun_fl_rl, color="red", size = 2) +
  theme_classic()

#making intraindividual change plot
IndPred = ggplot(data = verblong, aes(x = grade, y = verb, group = id)) +
   ggtitle("Individual level regressions only") +
  geom_smooth(method=lm,se=FALSE,colour="black", size=1) +
  xlab("Grade") + 
  ylab("WISC Verbal Score") + ylim(0,100) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,6,by=1)) +
  theme_classic()

plots(GCMpred, IndPred)
```


## Quadratic Growth Model

Quadratic time model (MLM): random intercepts and linear and quadratic slopes. 

![Quadratic Growth Model](imgs/model03.jpg)

```{r}
verblong$gradeSquared <- (verblong$grade)^2

fq_rq_fit <- lme(
  fixed = verb ~ 1 + grade + gradeSquared, 
  random = ~ 1 + grade|id + gradeSquared|id, 
  data=verblong,
  na.action = na.exclude,
  method = "ML"
)
summary(fq_rq_fit)
```

Let's test the significance of having random slopes. We compare models by applying `anova()` function to examine difference in fit between the two nested models. 

```{r}
anova(fl_rl_fit,fq_rq_fit)
```

From the test results we see they are different. 


Let's look at the predicted trajectories.

```{r}
verblong$pred_fq_rq <- predict(fq_rq_fit)
verblong$resid_fq_rq <- residuals(fq_rq_fit)

fun_fq_rq <- function(x) {
  fixef(fq_rq_fit)[[1]] + fixef(fq_rq_fit)[[2]]*x + fixef(fq_rq_fit)[[3]]*x^2
}

ggplot(data = verblong, aes(x = grade, y = pred_fq_rq, group = id)) +
  ggtitle("Fixed Quadratic, Random Quadratic") +
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Grade") + 
  ylab("PREDICTED WISC Verbal Score") + ylim(0,100) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,6,by=1)) + 
  stat_function(fun=fun_fq_rq, color="red", size = 2) +
  theme_classic()
```


## Conditional Growth Model

The growth curve modeling framework also allows us to consider other important questions regarding developmental change. For example, 

- Are the noted between-person differences in the trajectories of change related to
other measured between-person difference variables? 
- Can the variability we see in in the intercept and slope be explained by one or more time-invariant covariates?

### Conditional Growth Equation

![Conditional Growth Model](imgs/model04.jpg)


### Conditional Growth Model 1

Let's go back and look at our data. The data include 2 additional time-invariant covariates, `momed` and `grad`.

Let's add a predictor to our model. In this case we will add `grad` (which is coded 0,1) as a conditional predictor.

```{r}
cgm1_fit <- lme(
  fixed= verb ~ 1 + grade + grad + grade:grad, 
  random= ~ 1 + grade|id,
  data=verblong,
  na.action = na.exclude
)

summary(cgm1_fit)
```

#### Marginal Effects

Let's make grad ($=1$) and non-grad ($=0$) prototypical trajectories.

```{r}
#First lets extract the fixed effects
FE <- fixef(cgm1_fit)
FE
```

Create a function for the mean trends.

```{r}
#for grad = 0
fun_cgm_grad0 <- function(x) {
  grad=0
  FE[1] + FE[2]*x + FE[3]*grad + FE[4]*x*grad
}
#for grad = 1
fun_cgm_grad1 <- function(x) {
  grad=1
  FE[1] + FE[2]*x + FE[3]*grad + FE[4]*x*grad
}
```

Plot with the mean trends for no-grad (red) and grad (blue) trajectories.

```{r}
#plotting intraindividual change with overlay of group trends 
ggplot(data = verblong, aes(x = grade, y = verb, group = id)) +
  ggtitle("Raw Trajectories + Condition") +
  #  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Grade") + 
  ylab("WISC Verbal Score") + ylim(0,100) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,6,by=1)) + 
  stat_function(fun=fun_cgm_grad0, color="red", size = 2) +
  stat_function(fun=fun_cgm_grad1, color="blue", size = 2) +
  theme_classic()
```

Note, we can also use packages designed to produce and plot *marginal effects*. The `ggeffects` package is capable of producing marginal effects plots from ``lme` models. Here we produce the plots above in a single line of code. 

```{r}
pr <- ggeffects::ggpredict(cgm1_fit, terms = c("grade","grad"))
plot(pr)
```

### Conditional Growth Model 1

Now, let's consider `momed` as a (continuous) predictor. First, we will  center `momed` at sample-level mean. Note this is done using the wide data set.

Note, it is important to remember that the substantive interpretation of the level-2 regression parameters is affected by the scaling and centering of the time-invariant covariates. As in standard regression models, when time-invariant covariates are centered at their sample level means, the coefficients indicate the expected intercept and slope for an average person rather than for a hypothetical person with scores of zero on all the predictors.

```{r}
describe(wiscsub$momed)
#Calculating the mean 
momed_mean <- mean(wiscsub$momed)
momed_mean
#Calculating the sd for later use in plots
momed_sd <- sd(wiscsub$momed)
momed_sd

#Computing centered variable in long data
verblong$momed_c <- (verblong$momed-momed_mean)
describe(verblong$momed_c)
```

Fitting conditional growth model with momed (centered) as predictor

```{r}
cgm2_fit <- lme(
  fixed= verb ~ 1 + grade + momed_c + grade:momed_c, 
  random= ~ 1 + grade|id,
  data=verblong,
  na.action = na.exclude
)

summary(cgm2_fit)
```

#### Marginal Effects

We can extract the fixed effects for a prototypical trajectory. 

```{r}
#Extract the fixed effects
FE2 <- fixef(cgm2_fit)
FE2
```

Now, let's consider `momed` at the mean value, as well as low (-1SD) and high (+1SD) values. 

Low value of `momed`.    
 
```{r}
fun_cgm_momed_low <- function(x) {
  momed=0-1*momed_sd
  FE2[1] + FE2[2]*x + FE2[3]*momed + FE2[4]*x*momed
}
```

Average value of `momed`.    

```{r}
fun_cgm_momed_ave <- function(x) {
  momed=0
  FE2[1] + FE2[2]*x + FE2[3]*momed + FE2[4]*x*momed
}
```

High value of `momed`.    

```{r}
fun_cgm_momed_high <- function(x) {
  momed=0+1*momed_sd
  FE2[1] + FE2[2]*x + FE2[3]*momed + FE2[4]*x*momed
}
```

Plot with the prototypical -1SD (red), prototypical 0SD (magenta) and prototypical +1SD (blue) trajectories.

```{r}
#plotting intraindividual change with overlay
ggplot(data = verblong, aes(x = grade, y = verb, group = id)) +
  ggtitle("Raw Trajectories + Levels of Predictor") +
  #  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Grade") + 
  ylab("WISC Verbal Score") + ylim(0,100) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,6,by=1)) + 
  stat_function(fun=fun_cgm_momed_low, color="red", size = 2) +
  stat_function(fun=fun_cgm_momed_ave, color="purple", size = 2) +
  stat_function(fun=fun_cgm_momed_high, color="blue", size = 2) +
  theme_classic()
```


Again, we can obtain a similar plot using packages designed to plot marginal effects.

```{r}
mydf <- ggeffects::ggpredict(cgm2_fit, terms = c("grade","momed_c [meansd]"))
plot(mydf)
```

## Alternative Time Metrics

Let's go back to the simple *linear growth model*, this time being very explicit about the *scaling and centering* of the `time` variable. Time metric = original scores, Grade = 1, 2, 4, 6. Fitting the linear model with grade (as originally coded)

```{r}
linear_grade_fit <- lme(
  fixed= verb ~ 1 + grade, 
  random= ~ 1 + grade|id, 
  data=verblong,
  na.action = na.exclude
)

summary(linear_grade_fit)
```

**Important Questions to Ask**

- Where should the *intercept* be located?
  - Is there a meaningful *zero-time*? (choosing c1)
    - time since birth, time to death, time since surgery, time since meeting the research staff
- What should the time units be? (choosing c2)
  - years, months, minutes, grades, # of psychological events?
  
Using these quantities (c1 and c2) and the formula below it is possible to create alternative time metrics that may be more appropriate for the specific change process we are interested in:   

$$timenew = (time - c1)/c2$$   
where      
- c1 is a centering constant, and     
- c2 is a scaling constant.


### Recentering time metrics   

time_cG1 = Grade centered 0-point = grade 1: time_cG1 = 0, 1, 3, 5

time_cG6 = Grade centered 0-point = grade 6: time_cG6 = -5, -4, -2, 0

```{r}
verblong$time_cG1 = (verblong$grade - 1)/1
verblong$time_cG6 = (verblong$grade - 6)/1
```

### Rescaling time metric 
time_cG6 = Grade centered 0-point = grade 6: time_cG6rescale = -1.0, -0.8, -0.4, 0.0
```{r}
verblong$time_cG6rescale = (verblong$grade - 6)/5
```

### Remapping Time   

We may also want to remap time based on some other metric. For example, if we wanted to look at the number of assessment as indexing time. Here assessment would be the number of assessments youth have been exposed to: (assessment = 1, 2, 3, 4). Note: the way the mapping is done here only works in this case with no missing data. If have missing data, need to remap in a different way.

```{r}
#remapping using plyr 
verblong$assessment = mapvalues(verblong$grade,from= c(1,2,4,6),to= c(1,2,3,4))
```



### Compare Growth Metrics 

Let's look at the models with different time-metrics.

#### Time metric = grade

```{r}
linear_grade_fit <- lme(
  fixed= verb ~ 1 + grade, 
  random= ~ 1 + grade|id, 
  data=verblong,
  na.action = na.exclude
)
summary(linear_grade_fit)
```

#### Time metric = grade_cG1

time_cG1 = Grade centered 0-point = grade 1: time_cG1 = 0, 1, 3, 5

```{r}
linear_time_cG1_fit <- lme(
  fixed= verb ~ 1 + time_cG1, 
  random= ~ 1 + time_cG1|id, 
  data=verblong,
  na.action = na.exclude
)
summary(linear_time_cG1_fit)
```

#### Time metric = grade_cG6

time_cG6 = Grade centered 0-point = grade 6: time_cG6 = -5, -4, -2, 0

```{r}
linear_time_cG6_fit <- lme(
  fixed= verb ~ 1 + time_cG6, 
  random= ~ 1 + time_cG6|id, 
  data=verblong,
  na.action = na.exclude
)
summary(linear_time_cG6_fit)
```

#### Time metric = grade_cG6rescale

time_cG6 = Grade centered 0-point = grade 6: time_cG6rescale = -1.0, -0.8, -0.4, 0.0

```{r}
linear_time_cG6rescale_fit <- lme(
  fixed= verb ~ 1 + time_cG6rescale, 
  random= ~ 1 + time_cG6rescale|id, 
  data=verblong,
  na.action = na.exclude
)
summary(linear_time_cG6rescale_fit)
```

#### Time metric = assessment

Assessment = 1, 2, 3, 4

```{r}
linear_assessment_fit <- lme(
  fixed= verb ~ 1 + assessment, 
  random= ~ 1 + assessment|id, 
  data=verblong,
  na.action = na.exclude
)
summary(linear_assessment_fit)
```
